It does not remember who you are and what you did or what you like. This can be fairly complicated as many of the user experience you are used to get from KLU USA when using our website or app would cease to exist. Without this memory we, for example, cannot log you in as we forgot who you are. Or we cannot show you the rights language settings because we don’t know where you are coming from. So, all these useful functionalities which makes KLU USA so enjoyable would not be possible."

That sounds bad but as cookies also remember what you like there will be no advertising - or at least less advertising - that you are not interested in. Another scenario is that cookies will be used to know which of our marketing partners send you to us. If you click on a KLU USA ad on another website, this website uses cookies to let us know that you are coming from them."
