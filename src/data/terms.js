The following disclosures are made in accordance with the federal law regarding electronic payments, deposits, transfers of funds and other electronic transfers to and from your account(s). There may be limitations on account activity that restrict your ability to make electronic fund transfers. Any such limits are disclosed in the appropriate agreements governing your account. 1.	Electronic Fund Transfer: Any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft or similar paper instrument, that is initiated through an electronic device or computer to instruct us to debit or credit an account. Electronic Fund Transfers include such electronic transactions as direct deposits or withdrawals of funds, transfers initiated via telephone, website or mobile application. Preauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer: An Electronic Fund Transfer that you have authorized in advance to recur at substantially regular intervals; for example, direct deposits into or withdrawal of funds out of your account. Authorized Transfers: You are liable for all Electronic Fund Transfers that you authorize, whether directly or indirectly. Unauthorized Transfers: Tell us at once if you believe your Mobile App Login ID or password has been lost or stolen or if your Mobile App user account has been, or may have been, subject to Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers. Contact us immediately to keep your possible losses to a minimum. You could lose all the money in your Linked Account(s) and/or KLU USA Spending Account. If you tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss or theft of your Mobile App Login ID or password or after learning of any other Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers associated with your Mobile App user account, you can lose no more than $50. However, if you DO NOT tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss, theft or unauthorized use associated with your Mobile App user account, and we can establish that we could have prevented the Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer(s) if you had told us in time, you could lose as much as $500. If your periodic account statement issued by your bank or financial institution shows Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers and you DO NOT tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was delivered to you, you may not get back any money you lose after the sixtty (60) day period if we can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized transfer(s) if you had told us in time. If an extenuating circumstance (such as extended travel or hospitalization) prevents you from promptly notifying us of a suspected lost or stolen Mobile App Login ID or password or of any other suspected Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers(s), the time periods specified in this Section 20.2 may be extended for a reasonable period. 2.	Remote Deposit Capture. Via the Remote Deposit Capture Services we allow you to make deposits into your Account by using the mobile application to take a legible picture of the front and back of a negotiable check and transmitting such images. We will attempt to collect the item by presenting the image or converting the image into a digital representation of the original check (Substitute Check). Unlike traditional check deposits, you retain the original paper check when you use Remote Deposit Capture. We request you to retain the original check for at least thirty (30) days after you submit the check image to us. a.	Necessary endorsement. The checks to be deposited via Remote Deposit Capture shall be properly endorsed in the same manner in which it is made payable to you and with the restrictive endorsement For mobile deposit only. b.	Cut-off Time. Your check image must be received by 6:00 pm PST to be considered deposited in such day. Any check image received by us after 6:00 pm PST will be considered as deposited in the following business day. c.	Availability. The amount shall be made available in your account no later than two (2) business days after the day you made the Remote Deposit. We may place a hold on your deposited check for a longer period of time if we have reasonable cause to doubt collectability of the check. In case you deposit remotely a check in an amount higher than $200 (two hundred dollars) we will make $200 available to you no later than one (1) business day after the day after the day you made the deposit and the excess amount in no later than two (2) business days. d.	Longer Delays. In other circumstances, a longer hold period may apply before funds deposited by check are available in your Account. For example, a longer delay may apply in the following cases: (i) we believe a deposited check will not be paid; (ii) you deposit one or more checks totaling $5,000 or more in one day; (iii) you redeposit a check that has been previously returned unpaid; (iv) your Account had a negative balance anytime in the previous six (6) months; and (v) we experience an emergency, such as failure of communication or computer delays. We can delay the availability of your check if your deposit account was opened 30 days or less from the date you remotely deposited your check. In such cases, we will send you an electronic notice informing if your ability to withdraw funds is delayed for any reason and when your funds may be available. Generally, funds will be available no later than ten (10) business days after the deposit is accepted for processing. 3.	Wires: Wire transfers are electronic transfers, considered remittance transfers under US law, between two financial institutions. a. Time Restrictions. 10:00 AM PST is the cut off time for international wires,1:00 PM PST is the cut off time for domestic wire transfers. Any wire transfer instructions received after these times will be processed the following business day. b. Security Procedures. You will be required to use a Two-Factor Authentication control, in addition to your login, to authorize a wire transfer. This control is an appropriate security procedure, designed to verify the authenticity of the order, and not to detect errors in transmission. c. No Cancellation. All wire requests are final and are not subject to recall orders or stop payments. d. Payment Order. A wire transaction can only be initiated via our App. You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the information contained in the payment order. The wire transaction will be completed relying exclusively on the information provided by you. e. Authorization to Transfer Funds. Via the wire services, you must authorize Synapse’s partner bank(s) to execute payment orders on their behalf and to debit your account specified in the payment order for the amount of the wire transfer. 4. Users may report complaints relating to the bank services to our banking software provider, Xxxx through email xxxx@x.com or call(xxxxxxxx) 5. Transaction Limits: Users with bank services provided through Xxxxx, KLU USA’s banking software provider, will have the following limits per transactions:",

            text: '20.9 Error Resolution In case of errors or questions about your Electronic Fund Transfers, telephone us at 1-646-760-8040 or email us at support@klu.us. If you think your Linked Account statement, receipt, or payment history within the Mobile App are wrong, or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement, receipt, or within the Mobile App, contact us as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 90 days after the statement or receipt was delivered to you. In your notification to us, you must: A) Tell us your name and phone number associated with your Mobile App user account. B) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information. C) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days. We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your Linked Account or KLU USA Spending Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account. For errors involving new Mobile App user accounts, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new Mobile App user accounts, we may take up to 20 business days to credit your Linked Account or KLU USA Spending Account for the amount you think is in error. We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation. ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS MADE THROUGH THE KLU USA SERVICES MUST BE DIRECTED TO KLU USA, AND NOT TO THE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR LINKED ACCOUNT. We are responsible for the Services and for resolving any errors in transactions made in conjunction with such Services. We will not send you a periodic statement listing transactions that you make through the Services. The transactions will appear only on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution. SAVE THE RECEIPTS YOU ARE PROVIDED WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES, AND CHECK THEM AGAINST THE ACCOUNT STATEMENT YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. If you have any questions about one of these transactions, call or write us at the telephone number and address indicated below: Phone, KLU USA Inc. # Street # Floor City, State, PC, United Sates of America. Email: support@klu.us. IF YOUR MOBILE APP LOGIN ID OR PASSWORD IS LOST OR STOLEN, NOTIFY US AT ONCE by calling or writing to us at the telephone number or address listed above.'
